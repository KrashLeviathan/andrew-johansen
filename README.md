# [Andrew Johansen Website](http://krashleviathan.github.io/andrew-johansen)

## February 2016

This site was designed by Andrew Johansen and developed by me, Nathan Karasch.
Andrew sent me PDF and Adobe Illustrator files showing exactly how he wanted
the website to look and function. I worked my best to accommodate, and I am
pretty pleased with the outcome! I got really busy with schoolwork and passed
the project off before it was 100% complete, but I at least got it 95% of the
way there. I didn't want to hold back Andrew's career goals and what he hoped
to accomplish with the new website, so it seemed best to hand it off to someone
who could give it enough attention to complete it. Andrew was a great guy to
work with, and I hope his drumming career takes off!

I've got my 95% complete version of the site
[posted here](http://krashleviathan.github.io/andrew-johansen),
but when he finally launches the real thing, I'll stick a link to that site
on here as well.

## July 2016

I checked in on the status of Andrew's website, and you can see it live
[here!](http://www.andrewjohansenmusic.com/)
I'm happy that he finally got it up and running. There are some minor
differences between the final design and my version, but overall I'm happy
I was able to contribute. Congrats Andrew, and best of luck to you!
